**Docs: [https://gohjy.github.io/sgbus-widget/docs](https://gohjy.github.io/sgbus-widget/docs)**

With thanks to:
- [zero-md-docs] for the (extremely easy-to-use) docs template
- [zero-md] for inspiration for the documentation structure (even though this repo's one falls embarrasingly far)
- [arrivelah] for the proxy 

This project was based off my previous work with [nushbus].
